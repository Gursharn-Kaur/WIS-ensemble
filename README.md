# WIS-ensemble

This is the repository for **Enhanced Probabilistic Forecast through Weighted Interval Score Based Ensemble** (submitted in IAAI-2024).


We organize this repository as follows:

**data:** this folder contains all necessary data for the experimentation.

**Experimentation:** This folder contains seven Python files containing necessary codes.

**Ensemble_Forecasts.ipynb:** We show the forecast ensemble for Monroe County using the WIS-based LOP ensemble. This file can be used for generating ensemble forecasts for different counties using different ensemble methods (WIS-based LOP, WIS-based Vincent, Mean, and Median).
